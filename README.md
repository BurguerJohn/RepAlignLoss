# RepAlignLoss
RepAlignLoss is a PyTorch loss function designed for guiding the training of a 'student' model by aligning its internal feature representations with those of a pre-trained 'teacher' model. It encourages the student to learn perceptually relevant features by mimicking the internal activations of powerful foundation models.
